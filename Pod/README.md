The command -

```sh
 kubectl create -f pod-definition.yaml
```

reads the resource definition (in this case, a Pod definition) from the `pod-definition.yaml` file and instructs Kubernetes to create that Pod in your cluster.

Here’s what happens in detail:

1. Read the YAML File
   Kubernetes looks for the resource specifications (e.g., metadata, containers, volumes) in `pod-definition.yaml`.

2. Create the Resource
   Since this file describes a Pod, Kubernetes will attempt to create that Pod object in your currently selected namespace (unless otherwise specified).

3. Deploy the Pod
   After creating the Pod object, Kubernetes schedules it to run on one of your cluster nodes according to the configuration you’ve provided in the YAML file.

Overall, `kubectl create -f pod-definition.yaml` is used for creating any Kubernetes object from a definition file—Pod, Deployment, Service, etc. In this specific case, it creates the Pod defined in `pod-definition.yaml`.
